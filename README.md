# Kurt Riecken - React Portfolio [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)
  
## Description
  
This project is an expression of myself as a web designer and developer. I strive for clean, mobile-forward applications that guide the user in both form and function to the websites' central purpose, whatever that may be. I am always in search of new technologies and interfaces to explore and learn, both for a sense of personal enjoyment and fulfillment and in an effort to deliver the optimal solutions to my clients for their specific needs.

The 'About Kurt' section details some fun things you may not know about me! My interests lie primarily in software and web development but they extend to many things in addition.
